# Multilingual Implementation

## Current Approach

The SAPP Security website implements a basic multilingual system using React Context. This document outlines the current implementation and recommends improvements.

### Supported Languages

| Language | Code | Region Focus | Status |
|----------|------|--------------|--------|
| English (British) | `en` | United Kingdom | Complete |
| German | `de` | Germany | Partial |
| Dutch | `nl` | Netherlands | Partial |
| French | `fr` | France | Partial |

### Implementation Details

#### Language Context

The core of the multilingual system is the `LanguageContext` located at `src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`. This context provides:

1. The current language selection
2. A translation function (`t`) for looking up translations
3. A function to change the current language

#### Translation Function

The translation system works by:
1. Defining an object with translation keys and their values in each language
2. Using the `t` function to look up a key in the current language
3. Falling back to English if a translation is missing

#### Language Switching

Language switching is implemented through the `LanguageSelector` component, which:
1. Displays a globe icon in the navigation
2. Shows a dropdown with available languages when clicked
3. Changes the application language when a new option is selected
4. Displays a toast notification confirming the language change

#### TranslatedText Component

The `TranslatedText` component (`src/components/ui/TranslatedText.tsx`) is a wrapper that:
1. Takes a translation key as input
2. Uses the `t` function from the context to retrieve the translation
3. Renders the translated text or a fallback

## Current Limitations

1. **Limited Translation Coverage**:
   - Many hardcoded English strings throughout the application
   - Partial translations for non-English languages

2. **Scalability Issues**:
   - All translations stored in a single JavaScript object
   - No separation of concerns for different sections of the application

3. **Lack of Advanced Features**:
   - No pluralization support
   - No date/number formatting based on locale
   - No support for dynamic values in translations

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - No automated missing translation detection
   - No tooling for translation management

## Recommended Improvements

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Expand Translation Coverage**:
   - Audit application for untranslated strings
   - Complete translations for supported languages

2. **Refactor Translation Storage**:
   - Split translations into domain-specific files
   - Implement lazy loading of translation files

3. **Enhance TranslatedText Component**:
   - Add support for variables in translation strings
   - Implement basic pluralization

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Adopt a Comprehensive i18n Library**:
   - Consider implementing i18next or similar
   - Supports pluralization, formatting, nesting, etc.

2. **Implement Translation Management**:
   - Add tooling for extracting translation keys
   - Consider integration with translation services

3. **Add Cultural Adaptations**:
   - Adapt content beyond direct translation
   - Consider region-specific imagery and examples

4. **Improve Language Detection**:
   - Add automatic language detection based on browser settings
   - Remember user language preference in local storage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Translation Completion

1. Create translation templates for all pages
2. Complete English translations for all content
3. Have translations reviewed by native speakers

### Phase 2: Technical Improvements

1. Refactor translation storage structure
2. Enhance TranslatedText component capabilities
3. Implement language preference persistence

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Evaluate and implement i18n library
2. Add pluralization and formatting support
3. Implement automated translation workflow

## Metrics for Success

1. **Translation Coverage**: Percentage of UI elements with translations
2. **Language Switching Retention**: Users who stay on the site after switching languages
3. **Feedback by Language**: User satisfaction by language selection
